#UC Magazine  

### What problem are we trying to solve?  
+ Connect with students across other UC Campuses
+ Share information, event details, news, etc
+ Prospective, current, and alumni can learn about the Campuses

### Application Structure
The project was completed using __Web2Py Framework__. Most of the backend code is written in __Python__. The frontend code is written in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I used [__Material Design CSS__](http://materializecss.com) to design the website.  
My team and I implemented the __Facebook Share__ social plugin and __instagramfeed.js__.  
__CKEditor__ plugin was implemented to allow users have control over on how to style their articles.
