                        <p>UC Magazine is a forum-based platform for UC students from all UC campuses to get together and share their university-related stories. It is a platform to share stories about student life, campus events, and sports, as well as an easy way for students to share information about textbooks.</p>
                        <p>The inception of this project came from the realization that there wasn't really a well-established way for students of different UC campuses to communicate with one another. The campus lives amongst UCs are largely segregated. UC Magazine seeks to build a bridge across these barriers to allow students the outlet that they need to learn about what's going on in various UC campuses.</p>
